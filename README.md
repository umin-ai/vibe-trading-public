# Project Documentation: Vibe â€“ AI-Assisted Trading dApp on BNB Chain

> The release of Vibeâ€™s open-source code will be made available in the future.  
> During beta, this repository serves as public-facing documentation and a project overview.

## Overview

**Vibe** is an AI-assisted crypto trading application built for the **BNB Chain ecosystem**.  
It combines conversational AI with real-time blockchain data to help users make informed trading decisions through natural language interactions.  
The app follows a "vibe trading" philosophy â€” think "vibe coding" but for crypto trading â€” where users can ask questions and get intelligent, data-driven responses about tokens, markets, and trading opportunities.

**Key Philosophy**: This is a **self-custody** application.  
Vibe does not implement custodial accounts or burner wallets. Users connect their own Web3 wallets (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect-compatible) and maintain full control of their assets.
